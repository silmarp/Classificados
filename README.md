# CLASSIFICADOS
    A simple python web site using django
    
##HOW IT WORKS
###FRONT-END
    The site has 2 pages, one with just a search bar that sends a request to the back-end, and the other with the search bars and results of the search in card format.
    
###BACK-END
    After receiving the request from the search bar form it will run a simple script using beautiful soup that will scrape a web site, take the informations wanted (name, image, link and price) and send it to the front-front end to be rendered.
    In additions, every time that one search is made the keywords used will be saved in the database of the project, wich can be accessed when needed.
